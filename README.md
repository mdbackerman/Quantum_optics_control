# Quantum_optics_control

From June to September 2022 I worked in a quantum optics subgroup in the Lukin Group at Harvard University. The subgroup I was in studied 2D materials/TMDs (transition metal dichalcogenides) using spectroscopy and NV centers. During my time I built a CSLM (Confocal Scanning laser Microscope) and wrote software to control the setup for NV-based measurements. Software was written in Python in a Jupyter-Lab notebook and then moved to a GUI-based interface written from scratch using PyQt5. The [QCoDeS](https://qcodes.github.io) data-acquisition framework was used to run the experiment.

This file is the notebook running the setup on the optical bench. It contains all QCoDeS
