# Quantum_optics_control

From June to September 2022 I worked in a quantum optics subgroup in the Lukin Group at Harvard University. The subgroup I was in studied 2d materials/TMDs (transition metal dichalcogenides) using spectroscopy and NVs (nitrogren vacancy centers in diamonds). During my time I built a CSLM (Confocal Scanning laser Microscope) and wrote software to control the setup for NV (nitrogen vacancies in diamond) based measurements. Software was written in Python in a Jupyter-Lab notebook and then moved to a GUI-based interface written from sratch using PyQt5.
